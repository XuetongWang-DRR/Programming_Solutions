# Programming_Solutions
This is for the ITC course programming solutions.
In this course, we need to work on a code based project. I decided to use R since there are some packages have been used for statistical postprocessing. 
This project is a small part for my internship project, and I only included the modeling and graphs part here. If you are interested in other parts, you are
always welcome to contact by by email: x.wang-12@student.utwente.nl.

The modeling.R file is designed for training models, and predicts values for the testing group.
The Verification (making graphs).R file is designed for making comparison graphs for crps and bss.
